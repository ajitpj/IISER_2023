Each number is, ideally, proportional to the amount of light detected by one pixel in the detector.\n","\n","## 1. Let's examine a digital image first using ImageJ/Fiji and then numpy.\n","- [ImageJ/Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/) is an excellent point-and-click GUI-based application that I frequently use to examine imaging data and to create mock-up data analysis pipe-lines. ImageJ requires no coding, but provides an extensive collection of built-in functions and \"plug-ins\" for almost any image processing scenario. If you know Java, then you can create ImageJ based solutions for your problems.\n","- MatLab is the other commonly used application that comes with an excellent Image Processing library. However, it is not free to use!\n","- We will also use [napari](https://napari.org/stable/), which is a really slick and fast image viewer for python.\n","\n","Download the following movie, which captures dividing HeLa cells using Phase Contrast microscopy.
